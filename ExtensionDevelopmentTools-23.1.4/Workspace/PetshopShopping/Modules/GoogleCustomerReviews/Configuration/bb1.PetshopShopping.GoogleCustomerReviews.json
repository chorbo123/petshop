I have used this company a lot, and have always been very impressed with the selection of foods/treats/feliway/accessories for my cats, the prices are good compared to other websites (I tend to use about 5 to compare prices before buying and they are always competitive), I like their emails that they send and everything arrives on time! I get a notification from Hermes when it is out for delivery. There was one time where they had issues with their stock and as my cat food was late being shipped, they sent me a voucher for my next purchase, which a lot of places wouldn‚Äôt bother to do. I can only suggest that you give them a go and see what you think yourself!",
